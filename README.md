# Super-Trim
A Minecraft datapack that enables all items as valid armor trimming materials.

**Only for version 23w04a or later**

A new update recently allowed us to trim armor using ten different materials. Using this data pack, you will be able to use ANY ITEM YOU WANT!

## Usage instructions
In order to use the data pack, first the experimental `update_1_20` data pack must be enabled. You can do that when creating a new world by choosing **Data Packs** and then enabling the experimental data pack. You can then add this data pack like any other data pack ([instructions](https://www.planetminecraft.com/blog/how-to-download-and-install-minecraft-data-packs/)). **You also have to download and use the resource pack in order for the data pack to work.** Then, pick up a smithing table, an armor trimming smithing template, any piece of armor (except leather) and any item you want and trim your armor (see the picture)!

## Limitations (aka bugs I didn't bother to solve)
- Shift+click in the smithing table UI sometimes doesn't work.
- Spawn eggs and leaves trim armor in shades of gray.
- Blocks with different sides only use one side to determine how the trim would look.
- Dark materials make unreadable descriptions.
